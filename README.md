# COVID-19 Travel Monitoring System

**Introduction:**

The COVID-19 Travel Monitoring System is a Java-based program designed to address the urgent need for efficient monitoring of cross-government travel and consent during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The program assists law enforcement agencies in identifying applicants seeking permission to cross government boundaries, ensuring compliance with travel restrictions and minimizing the risk of virus transmission.

**Features:**

- **Applicant Health Monitoring:** The system facilitates the comprehensive monitoring of applicants' health to assess their eligibility for cross-government travel.

- **Travel Consent Verification:** Ensures that applicants have the necessary consent and permissions to travel, helping authorities in making informed decisions.

- **Data Organization:** Efficiently organizes and manages applicant data to streamline the monitoring process.

- **Exception Handling:** Implements robust exception handling to manage unforeseen scenarios gracefully.

**OOP Concepts Applied:**

- **Encapsulation:** Data and methods relevant to each class are encapsulated, promoting modular and maintainable code.

- **Association:** Classes are associated to represent relationships between entities, fostering a comprehensive understanding of the system.

- **Aggregation/Composition:** Appropriate use of aggregation and composition enhances the modeling of relationships between classes.

- **Inheritance:** Utilizes inheritance to promote code reuse and establish a hierarchical structure.

- **Interface & Implements:** Interfaces are used to define contracts that classes must adhere to, promoting flexibility and modularity.

- **Exception Handling:** Robust exception handling mechanisms are implemented to manage errors gracefully.
